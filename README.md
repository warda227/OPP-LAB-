## Week-1:
### Experiment 01
Write a program that declares a structure based on the following entity shown in the box. The program must declare and initialize an instance of the structure entity i.e. Student. The attributes of the entity are shown in oval shapes associated with the entity. Use the following data type for the attributes of the student:

* integer for studentID
* char* for studentName
* char* for courscode
* char* for courseName
* integer for courseMarks

Experiment 02
Create a structure of type Date that contains three members: the month, the day of the month, and the year, all of type int. (Or use day-month-year order if you prefer.) Have the user enter a date in the format 12/31/2001, store it in a variable of type struct Date, then retrieve the values from the variable and print them out in the same format.

Experiment 03:
Create a structure called Employee that contains two members: an employee number (type int) and the employee’s compensation (in dollars; type float). Ask the user to fill in this data for three employees, store it in three variables of type struct Employee, and then display the information for each employee. Use a seperate display function for the information display.

Week02
Experiment 01
Write a program to define a structure with 5 members. The first member be student name and the other member be student roll number and marks obtained in 3 subjects. Input values from the user. Add the marks of the subject and calculate the total marks and then print these numbers and total marks of the student.

Experiment 02
Create a structure of type Date that contains three members: the month, the day of the month, and the year, all of type int. (Or use day-month-year order if you prefer.) Have the user enter a date in the format 12/31/2001, store it in a variable of type struct Date, then retrieve the values from the variable and print them out in the same format.

Experiment 03
Create a structure called Employee that contains two members: an employee number (type int) and the employee’s salary (in dollars; type float). Ask the user to fill in this data for three employees and then display the information for each employee. Use a separate display function for the information display.

Week03
Experiment 01
Design a class called Date. The class should store a date in three integers: month, day, and year. There should be member functions to print the date in the following forms: 12/25/2014 December 25, 2014 25 December 2014

Demonstrate the class by writing a complete program implementing it.

Input Validation: Do not accept values for the day greater than 31 or less than 1. Do not accept values for the month greater than 12 or less than 1.

Experiment 02

Position: A string that holds the employee’s job title
A constructor that accepts the following values as arguments and assigns them to the appropriate member variables: employee’s name, employee’s ID number, department, and position A constructor that accepts the following values as arguments and assigns them to the appropriate member variables: employee’s name and ID number. The department and position fields should be assigned an empty string ("") A default constructor that assigns empty strings ("") to the name, department, and position member variables, and 0 to the idNumber member variable

Write appropriate setter/getter functions that store values and return the values in these member variables. Once you have written the class, write a program that creates three Employee objects to hold the following data.

The program should store this data in the three objects and then display the data for each employee on the screen.

Experiment 02

radius: a double
pi: a double initialized with the value 3.14159
The class should have the following member functions:

Default Constructor: A default constructor that sets radius to 0.0
Constructor: Accepts the radius of the circle as an argument
setRadius: A mutator function for the radius variable
getRadius: An accessor function for the radius variable
getArea: Returns the area of the circle, which is calculated as: area = pi * radius * radius
getDiameter: Returns the diameter of the circle, which is calculated as: diameter = radius * 2
getCircumference: Returns the circumference of the circle, which is calculated as: circumference = 2 * pi * radius
Write a program that demonstrates the Circle class by asking the user for the circle’s radius, creating a Circle object, and then reporting the circle’s area, diameter, and circumference.

Experiment 03

quantity	An int for holding the quantity of the items on hand.
cost	A double for holding the wholesale per unit cost of the item.
totalCost	A double for holding the total inventory cost of the item (quantity * cost).
Public Member Functions

Member Function	Description
Inventory()	Default constructor that sets all member variables to 0.
Inventory(int item, int qty, double c)	Constructor that accepts item number, quantity, and cost. It stores the values and calls setTotalCost().
setItemNumber(int item)	Stores the item number.
setQuantity(int qty)	Stores the quantity.
setCost(double c)	Stores the cost per item.
setTotalCost()	Calculates and stores quantity * cost in totalCost.

Input Validation

The program should not accept negative values for:

itemNumber
quantity
cost
If a negative value is entered, the user should be asked to enter the value again.

Example

Enter item number: 101
Enter quantity: 5
Enter cost per item: 12.5

Inventory Details
Item Number: 101
Quantity: 5
Cost per Item: 12.5
Total Cost: 62.5
Week05
Experiment 01
Design a Payroll class that has data members for an employee’s hourly pay rate, number of hours worked, and total pay for the week. Write a program with an array of seven Payroll objects. The program should ask the user for the number of hours each employee has worked and will then display the amount of gross pay each has earned.

Input Validation: Do not accept values greater than 60 for the number of hours worked.

Experiment 2
The objective of this exercise is to understand the declaration of a class with its data members and member functions, and the concept of passing objects as function parameters.

Create a class Travel with two data members: kilometer and hour. Class member functions:

input() : void
show() : void
add(Travel p) : void — accepts an object of Travel as a parameter, adds the values of data members of the parameter object and the calling object, and displays the result.
Instructions:

Declare two objects t1 and t2 of class Travel and input data in both objects.
Call the add function with t1 object and pass t2 object as an argument.
Experiment 03
The objective of this exercise is to understand the concept of static data members.

Write a class Capital with one static data member count, which counts the number of objects created of a particular class.

Week 06
Experiment 01
Write a class definition ComplexNumber with two data members: realPart and imaginaryPart. We wish to perform addition, subtraction, and multiplication with objects of the ComplexNumber class.

A complex number c = a + bj consists of two parts: the real part a and the imaginary part bj. We can perform arithmetic operations on complex numbers as follows:

Addition (+): (a1 + b1j) + (a2 + b2j) = (a1 + a2) + (b1 + b2)j
Subtraction (-): (a1 + b1j) – (a2 + b2j) = (a1 – a2) + (b1 – b2)j
Multiplication (*): (a1 + b1j) * (a2 + b2j) = (a1a2 – b1b2) + (a1b2 + a2b1)j Create objects of this class and test all the member functions.
Experiment 02
The objective of this exercise is to how to learn the friend function of a class. Room

width : double
printWidth(Room) : friend void
setWidth(double) : void
Procedure

Do the exercise and create an object of the Room class and call the setWidth() function to pass 10.10 as the argument value. Later print the width of the room by calling the printWidth(Room) function. But see this function is a friend of the Room class, so this will not be a member of the class. Therefore we shall define it outside the class, rather than using the :: operators with the class member function definition.

Experiment 03
Create a class Named Student which can save student information containing Roll Number, First Name, Last Name, Student class, Marks (can be in points) and grade. Set default values for class members in default constructor. Student Information to Store

Roll Number
First Name
Last Name
Student Class
Total Marks
Grade
All the class members will be private and no getter setters would be created to set or get the values.

Overload constructor to initialize private class members with user provided values.
Create a function DisplayClassData which accepts the address of class student as argument.
This function should display all data (private data members) in the function.

Week 07
Experiment 01
Write a program that declares a Complex data type having real and imaginary as its private members. Using operator overloading declares an additional operator that helps in adding two complex objects. Similarly overload the = operator to assign one value of a complex object to the other complex object. I.e. Complex c, b; c – b; c+b; and c*b;

Complex
double rp; // real part of the complex number
double ip; // imaginary part of the complex number
Complex(double, double)
Complex operator+(const Complex&)
Complex operator-(const Complex&)
Complex operator*(const Complex&)
void print()
Experiment 02
Design a class named Month. The class should have the following private members:

name A string object that holds the name of a month, such as “January,” “February,”
monthNumber An integer variable that holds the number of the month. For example, January would be 1, February would be 2, etc. Valid values for this variable are 1 through 12.
In addition, provide the following member functions:

A default constructor that sets monthNumber to 1 and name to “January.”
A constructor that accepts the name of the month as an argument. It should set name to the value passed as the argument and set monthNumber to the correct value.
A constructor that accepts the number of the month as an argument. It should set monthNumber to the value passed as the argument and set name to the correct month name.
Appropriate set and get functions for the name and monthNumber member variables.
Prefix and postfix overloaded ++ operator functions that increment monthNumber and set name to the name of next month. If monthNumber is set to 12 when these functions execute, they should set monthNumber to 1 and name to “January.”
Prefix and postfix overloaded − − operator functions that decrement monthNumber and set name to the name of previous month. If monthNumber is set to 1 when these functions execute, they should set monthNumber to 12 and name to “December.”
Also, you should overload cout ’s << operator and cin ’s >> operator to work with the Month class. Demonstrate the class in a program.
Week 08
Experiment 01
The objective of this exercise is to understand how to create derived classes. Imagine a publishing company that markets both book and audiocassette versions of its works. Create a class Publication that stores

the title (a string) and
price (type float) of a publication.
Book, which adds

a page count (type int), and
Tape, which adds

a playing time in minutes (type float).
Each of these three classes should have a getdata() function to get its data fromthe user at thekeyboard and a putdata() function to display its data

Write a main() program to test the Book and Tape classes by creating instances of them, askingtheuser to fill in data with getdata(), and then displaying the data with putdata().

Experiment 02
Design a class named Employee. The class should keep the following information in

Employee name  Employee number
Hire date
Write one or more constructors and the appropriate accessor and mutator functions for the class.

Next, write a class named ProductionWorker that is derived from the Employee class. The ProductionWorker class should have member variables to hold the following information:

Shift (an integer)
Hourly pay rate (a double )
The workday is divided into two shifts: day and night. The shift variable will hold an integer valuerepresenting the shift that the employee works. The day shift is shift 1, and the night shift is shift 2. Writeone or more constructors and the appropriate accessor and mutator functions For the class. Demonstratetheclasses by writing a program that uses a ProductionWorker object.

Experiment 03
In a particular factory a shift supervisor is a salaried employee who supervises a shift. In additiontoasalary, the shift supervisor earns a yearly bonus when his or her shift meets production goals.

Design a ShiftSupervisor class that is derived from the Employee class you created in above task. The ShiftSupervisor class should have a member variable that holds the annual salary and a member variable that holds the annual production bonus that a shift supervisor has earned.

Write one or more constructorsand the appropriate accessor and mutator functions for the class. Demonstrate the class by writing a program that uses a ShiftSupervisor object.
